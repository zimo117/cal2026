<h2>Cal 2026 - Tradfi and DeFi convergence</h2>
<p>The <strong>Crypto Asset Lab Conference 2026</strong> sets its focus on one of the most consequential developments in finance today: the accelerating convergence of <strong>traditional finance (TradFi)</strong> and <strong>decentralised finance (DeFi)</strong>. This is not merely a technological evolution—it is a redefinition of how value is issued, transferred, and settled across institutional and decentralised architectures.</p>
<p>At the centre of this transformation is a growing trend: financial instruments traditionally confined to centralised infrastructures are being reimagined in tokenised, programmable forms.</p>
<p>Take, for example, <strong>BlackRock’s tokenised money market fund</strong>, issued on public blockchain infrastructure. This isn’t a theoretical use case—it’s a live, operational product that combines the familiarity of regulated instruments with the composability and transparency of DeFi protocols.</p>
<p>Similarly, <strong>J.P. Morgan’s JPMD (tokenised deposit)</strong> initiative is pushing commercial bank money onto public chains. But why is one of the world’s largest banks placing regulated deposits in tokenised form on permissionless infrastructure? The answer may lie in the need for real-time, cross-platform settlement mechanisms that bridge commercial, central bank, and crypto-native forms of value.</p>
<p>Stablecoins, long viewed as peripheral instruments, are now being pulled into the regulatory mainstream. The <strong>GENIUS Act</strong> in the United States is a case in point—a legislative proposal that aims to bring stablecoin issuance under clear regulatory oversight, acknowledging their growing role in retail and wholesale payments.</p>
<p>Yet even as the U.S. remains cautious about central bank digital currencies, <strong>blockchain-based financial market infrastructure (FMI)</strong> is gaining global momentum. In the UK, the <strong>Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS)</strong> is providing legal and regulatory cover for the settlement of tokenised assets. Across Europe, the <strong>DLT Pilot Regime</strong> is testing new models of market operation. And increasingly, these experiments are giving way to full-scale systems.</p>
<p>Consider the <strong>Fnality Payment System (FNPS)</strong>—a wholesale payment system based on blockchain principles, set to go live in the UK and actively being developed for the U.S. dollar market. FNPS aims to replicate the safety of central bank money while offering the programmability and atomic settlement capabilities of smart contracts.</p>
<p>This momentum extends beyond new market entrants. Established financial infrastructure providers are adapting rapidly. <strong>DTCC’s “Great Collateral Experiment”</strong> demonstrates how tokenised collateral can enhance capital efficiency. Meanwhile, <strong>SWIFT’s collaboration with Chainlink</strong> explores how cross-chain messaging can extend the reach of existing global networks into decentralised environments.</p>
<p>All of this unfolds in a fast-evolving regulatory landscape. International bodies like the <strong>Bank for International Settlements (BIS)</strong>, as well as national regulators, are working to understand and shape the future architecture of financial markets—one that may be partly centralised, partly decentralised, and fully interconnected.</p>
<h2>Why now?</h2>
<p>We live at the dawn of a new era of Finance and it is paramount for every player to understand where we came from, and where we are going. </p>
<p>This conference is a space designed to achieve this: bringing together crypto-native players, tradfi incumbents, academics, and regulators. </p>
<p> <strong>Therefore, we invite you to submit your papers and be part of the discussion as, together, we will explore the future of finance.</strong> </p>
